## **Innovation Insight for Microservices**

According to Gartner, "Microservices enable unprecedented agility and scalability, but the architecture causes significant cultural disruption. Application leaders should understand this new design paradigm, its prerequisites and its disruptive impact before determining where and when to use it — if at all."

"A microservice is a tightly scoped, strongly encapsulated, loosely coupled, independently deployable and independently scalable application component. Microservices architecture applies service-oriented architecture (SOA) and domain-driven design (DDD — see Note 1) principles to deliver distributed applications. MSA has three core objectives: development agility, deployment flexibility and precise scalability."
